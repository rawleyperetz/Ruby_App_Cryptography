# Ruby_App_Cryptography
A desktop application built with Glade, Gtk3 and Ruby. It is a simple app for bruteforcing ciphertext using Caesar's cipher and also Vigenere's cipher is available. I hope to include more cryptosystems to it. Fingers croseed tho. Any suggestions on how to better the app or style of code will be greatly appreciated as I am a beginner to Ruby programming and also inexperienced programmer in search for oppportunities. I hope you enjoy it.
